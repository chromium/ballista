**Ballista** is a project to explore inter-website and web/native communication;
specifically, communication between one website and another site or native app
of the user's choosing. We want the user to be able to *share* or *edit*
documents in another website or app that the first website has never even heard
of, *choose* documents from another website, or register a website as a *native
file handler*. We're attempting to solve similar problems to the intents system
on Android, but also address other use cases like document editing. Essentially,
we want to create an **interoperability system for the web**.

Our [explainer document](docs/explainer.md) dives deeper into the problem space
and outlines an API that we think solves this problem. But this is less about
proposing an API, and more about starting a conversation, so take a look, and
let us know what you think (contact details below).

## Resources

* For a detailed overview, see [Ballista Explained](docs/explainer.md).
* In the `polyfill` directory, there is a partial polyfill. This doesn't allow
  websites to register as handlers, but is sufficient to set up a bidirectional
  action flow between two participating sites.
* In the `handler` and `requester` directories are sample apps that work
  together.

See the `README.md` file in each directory for details. Many caveats apply.

## Who is behind Ballista?

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just
code that happens to be owned by Google.
